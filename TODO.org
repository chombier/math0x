* pca, svd ?

* ccsk/cckf ?

* link Ad to AdT using pullback ?

* performances tests ?

* func::any copies ?

* function operators
	- return types requires, mostly

	- adT(x) coalg -> coalg
	 
* harmonize make_ ... and friends
	
	- in progress, almost done
		
* SO3
	- ad, adT

* SE3
	- exp/log push/pull ? use general formula ?
	- Ad, AdT, ad, adT

* SL3
  - sl3
  - sl3T

* complex numbers ?
  - CC 
	- is this useful ?
		
* rigid body kinematics

* splines 
 - mmhhh...
 - lambdas would be great for hermite functions

* lambdas ?

* coords ?
* get rid of the nasty ::base member type ?
	- does not seem possible :-/
