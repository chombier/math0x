* performances tests ?
		 
* modules ?
  - to include parts of the lib directly

* Functions
** optimize func::any copies ?
	 
** harmonize make_ ... and friends
	 - in progress, almost done


** splines 
	 - almost there, needs a node storage/selection class

** lambdas ?
	 - clang is doing a good job at the pythy synthax, but has trouble
     when combined with tuple magic :-/

** get rid of the nasty ::base member type trick ?
	 - does not seem possible :-/

** coords ?
	 - convert between euclid/coordinates
	
** DONE function operators
	 - return types requires, mostly

* Lie group structure

** lie brackets/cobrackets
	 - ad(x) alg -> alg
	 - adT(x) coalg -> coalg
		 	
** general formula for exponential/logarithm derivative
	 - pullback ?


** link Ad to AdT using pullback ?
		
** ccsk/ccfk
** pga

* actual Lie groups
** SO3
	 - ad, adT

** SE3
	 - exp/log push/pull ? use general formula ?
	 - Ad, AdT, ad, adT
	 - rigid body kinematics
		 
** SL3
   - sl3
   - sl3T

** GL3
	 - gl3 ? use mat33 as algebra/coalgebra ? seems logical
	 - also, quick inverse ?

** complex numbers ?
   - CC 
	 - is this useful ?

* pca, svd ?
	- and friends ?
