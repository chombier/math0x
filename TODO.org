* lie brackets/cobrackets
** it should actually be:

for x,y in algebra

   ad(x)(y);
   adT(x)(y); => 


* machine precision ?
  std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon

* harmonize make_ ... and friends
	
* SO3
  - exp/log
	- derivatives ?
	- pullbacks ?  

* dual quaternions (?), rigid transforms

* SE3
  - se3
  - se3T

* SL3
  - sl3
  - sl3T

* complex numbers ?
  - CC 

* rigid body kinematics
  
* splines 
  
* lambdas ?

* get rid of the nasty ::base member type ?
** used to get nested push::push types right  
  
** does not seem possible, we need to flag base class one way or another :-/
   
* modules ?
  to include parts of the lib directly
