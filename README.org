*Warning:* This is completely work in progress and nowhere near a
releasable state.

*group* is a small c++11 template library for doing differential
geometry in Lie groups. It can be used to automatically compute
complicated derivatives/pullbacks, for instance when dealing with
robot kinematics.

*group* tries to provide a high degree of flexibility by providing a
collection of small, atomic functions that can be chained together to
form more complex functions. This composition happens at compile time,
so that the compiler will +beg for mercy+ do its best to produce
efficient code.

You can use your custom data types with *group* by implementing a few
/trait classes/ describing Euclidean and Lie group operations. Since
most of the functions in ~group~ only use these interfaces, you will
be able to use them right away in your code. For instance, you can use
*Eigen* vectors with *group*.
