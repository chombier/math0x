Group

~group~ is a small c++11 template library for doing differential
geometry in Lie groups. It can be used to automatically compute
complicated derivatives/pullbacks, for instance when dealing with
robot kinematics.

~group~ tries to provide a high degree of flexibility by providing a
collection of small, atomic functions that can be chained together to
form more complex functions, at compile time.

You can use your custom data types with ~group~ by implementing a few
trait classes describing /Euclidean/ and /Lie group/ operations. Since
most of the functions in ~group~ only use these interfaces, you will
be able to use them right away in your code.
