Group

=group= is a small c++11 template library for doing differential
geometry in Lie groups. It can be used to automatically compute
complicated derivatives/pullbacks, for instance when dealing with
robot kinematics.

=group= tries to provide a high degree of flexibility by providing a
collection of small, atomic functions that can be chained together to
form more complex functions, at compile time.

You can use your custom data types with =group= by implementing a few
trait classes describing Euclidean and Lie group operations. Since
